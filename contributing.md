# Contributing

Feel free to create a pull request to add or change pages. It's simple to locally test this website to view your changes so have a go!

## Requirements

* We recommend [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for handling multiple versions of node and npm.
* NPM 6.9.0
* Node v10.16.3

Other versions may work, but those are the versions which were used to generate the site. It's also possible to locally host the site using [Python instead.](https://jhildenbiddle.github.io/docsify-themeable/#/quick-start?id=local-preview)

## Local Preview

1. First you will need to clone the repository (top right to view the repository)

2. Then you will need to navigate to inside of the repository with the command line/terminal/cmd

3. Next you need to run the following to install docsify (globally is recommended)
`npm install -g docsify-cli`

4. Finally serve the files with
`docsify serve`

5. Navigate to localhost:3000 in your browser

After this inital setup, you will only need to repeat steps 2, 4 and 5, making sure to update the repository if needed. You will not need to repeat step 4 when making changes since all changes are applied straight away.
